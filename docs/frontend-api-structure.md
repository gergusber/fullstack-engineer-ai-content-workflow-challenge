- Individual campaign details with caching
- Campaign statistics with appropriate refresh intervals
- Campaign creation and update mutations with cache invalidation

### **2. Content Hooks with Translation Support** ‚úÖ
Dual hook system for content management:
- **useContentList()**: Default hook that excludes translations for clean UI
- **useAllContentList()**: Special hook that includes translations when needed
- **useContent()**: Individual content retrieval with related data
- **useContentTranslations()**: Translation data for specific content pieces

### **3. Content Mutations** ‚úÖ
Comprehensive mutation hooks covering:
- Content creation with automatic cache updates
- Content updates with optimistic UI updates
- Translation creation with workflow integration
- AI content generation with preview support
- Review operations (submit, approve, reject) with workflow automation

### **4. Translation Hooks** ‚úÖ
Specialized hooks for translation management:
- Real-time pending translations with 30-second refresh intervals
- Translation dashboard with bulk operation support
- Translation approval and rejection workflows

### **5. Workflow Automation Hooks** ‚úÖ
Business logic automation including:
- **Campaign Workflow**: Automatic campaign status updates based on content changes
- **Content Workflow**: Automated approval processes with campaign integration
- Progress tracking and user notification systems

## üèõÔ∏è Translation Architecture Implementation

### **Current Translation Management** ‚úÖ

The system implements a **dual approach** with smart UI filtering to solve translation display issues:

**Backend Storage Strategy:**
- Translation entities for proper translation records with quality scores
- ContentPiece records with translationOf references for legacy support

**Frontend Filtering (Quick Fix Solution):**
- Default behavior hides translated content pieces for clean UI
- Optional visibility toggle for power users who need complete views
- Manual override capability for specific use cases

**UI Implementation:**
- **Default View**: Shows all content including translations (user requested change)
- **Toggle Action**: "Hide translations" button to filter out translated content pieces
- **Visual Indicators**: Orange translation badges and blue header indicators
- **Content Detail Integration**: Translations accessible via tabs with clear navigation

### **Translation Workflow Features** ‚úÖ

**Translation Creation:**
- AI-powered translation with multiple model support (Claude, OpenAI)
- Translation type selection (literal, localized, culturally adapted)
- Quality scoring and confidence assessment

**Translation Review:**
- Human review and approval workflows
- Quality assessment and cultural adaptation notes
- Approval/rejection with detailed feedback

**Translation Management:**
- Dashboard for bulk translation management
- Real-time pending translation tracking
- Integration with content approval workflows

## üéØ Key Implementation Features

### **1. Smart Content Filtering** ‚úÖ
- **Clean Default Views**: All content visible by default with option to hide translations
- **Toggle Functionality**: Easy switching between complete and filtered views
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear marking when translations are hidden or shown

### **2. AI Integration** ‚úÖ
- **Mock Response System**: Development mode without external API dependencies
- **Preview Workflow**: Review and approve AI content before final saving
- **Multi-Model Support**: Integration with both Claude and OpenAI APIs

### **3. Workflow Automation** ‚úÖ
- **Campaign Status Management**: Automatic status updates based on content progress
- **Content Approval Process**: Structured review and approval workflows
- **User Feedback System**: Toast notifications for all user actions

### **4. Type Safety** ‚úÖ
- **End-to-End Types**: Consistent type definitions from API to UI
- **Query Key Safety**: Type-safe cache invalidation patterns
- **Service Layer Types**: Strongly typed API interactions

### **5. Performance Optimization** ‚úÖ
- **Intelligent Caching**: Context-aware cache management with proper invalidation
- **Background Updates**: Real-time data synchronization for translations
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for better user experience

## üö¶ Production Implementation Examples

### **Campaign Content Management**
The CampaignContentManager component now starts with all content visible by default, including translations. Users can choose to hide translations for a cleaner view using the toggle button. This approach provides maximum visibility by default while allowing users to simplify the view when needed.

### **Translation Management**
ContentDetail components show a blue banner for translated content pieces with easy navigation to original content. The translation tab provides access to all translations for original content pieces, with proper quality score display and cultural notes.

### **AI Content Generation**
Content creation includes a preview-before-save workflow where users can review AI-generated content before accepting it as the final content. This ensures quality control while leveraging AI assistance.
